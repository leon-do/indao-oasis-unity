## Story

Many scientists believe that SARS-CMV-2 is virus spread from a genetically-modified cucumber to humans. Trillions of people have been infected with the virus. Few have survived. 

Due to SARS-CMV-2 pandamic, the Meta Galactic Empire decided to shut down all interplanatary trade. This led to a period of extremely high tention between the Interplanatary Decentralized Autonamous Organization and the Meta Galactic Empire.
